Clone this git: https://github.com/taplank/seam-carver  
Specify path_to_cache and path_to_img, and create folders named “vert” and “horiz” inside the cache folder. It will cache the images in form carved_1, carved_2, etc. in the cache path 
Run the code, and select whether you want to SCALE the image vertically or horizontally
It will take a while because it’s python, so start with a small image or scale your image to 50% (75% less pixels) 

Also, the folders load weird on git, but they also have videos at the end to show the seam carving over time.
